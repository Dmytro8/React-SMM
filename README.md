# React_Social_Net
This is the project from which I started to learn and use the React library.
For the management state, I chose and used Redux.

## Functionality
The general topic of the website is social communication.

I decided to choose this topic for the first React project because I wanted to realize basic functionality there.

At first, I created pages for availability to login and registration of new users.

For the login form, I used Redux Form, added simple validation. I use own API, written in Python.

The whole project contains the next functionality:
 - log in to the page
 - log out from the page
 - receiving all users from API
 - user can add a new post to his wall
 - user can start a conversation with another user and send to him messages
 - user can follow on another user
 - user can set and update the profile status

Project doesn't related with database and all users actions are local and won't be saved

You also can test my project, just enter next login data:

**email** - `robert.downey@gmail.com`

**password** - `robertDowney`

**The API is deployed on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">**Heroku**</a> and it can be in sleep mode, you should wait a while the server is started**
